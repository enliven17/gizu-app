# Wallet-2 liquid-asset recovery — September 29, 2026

Requested recovery: Ethereum wallet `0x4943a374C5a765D33F626a9D85C265dD6287FCe5` → Monad USDC at the user-confirmed existing source `0xbFF2675Fb450c21aE1c42FEFE65999EA6f4D9285`.

This one-off recovery is separate from the confidential earn lifecycle. It uses public NEAR Intents 1Click routes. Wallet 1 is not involved. Quotes, exact local-fork simulations, signed transactions, receipts and settlement responses are saved privately in `.local/recovery/`.

Starting liquid balance: 1.731762 USDC and 0.000707811898201088 ETH. Starting Monad source: 8.003889 USDC. The old 0.133013839453606864 vault shares were not part of the requested liquid recovery and remain invested; their read-only redemption preview was 0.134157 USDC.

## Route comparison

NEAR Intents was cheapest among the usable quotes checked, including Ethereum execution gas. At the compared small amounts:

| Path | Measured local Ethereum gas | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| NEAR USDC transfer | 57,448 | No approval; about 0.004379 USDC bridge/spread difference |
| Relay USDC approval + deposit | 104,641 | About 0.020480 USDC quoted route difference |
| Across USDC approval + deposit | 124,335 | About 0.000969 USDC quoted route difference |
| NEAR native ETH transfer | 21,000 | Plain transfer to verified empty-code deposit address |
| Relay native ETH deposit | 24,824 | Additional quoted route cost |

The Across ETH swap-and-bridge quote reverted on the pinned fork and was not used. Fusion's small USDC-to-ETH quote yielded only about 0.954 USDC worth of ETH for 1.731762 USDC input before a subsequent bridge; it was worse. Provider quotes are time-sensitive, not universal fee claims.

USDC used EIP-1559 pricing to pay the actual inclusion price. The ETH sweep used an exact 21,000-gas legacy transaction: value = current ETH balance − 21,000 × current selected gas price, verified locally with the real wallet balance. No new helper or paymaster was used.

## Execution

- USDC funding: `0xf568fd22b738d426834e8f74a0a23cad79d18c892196f06c734f0e75ed849408`. Confirmed success; actual gas 57,448, gas cost 0.000190006429307248 ETH. Monad output: 1.727383 USDC. Monad receipt transaction: `0x25239c1410eb5fd8abc167a4364adb3c4274cb2b4e2973ef654bc5b94b037f9c`.
- ETH funding: `0x1bee83336c4fcb347fb8c30ef50bd17bd63275320ce5fac4f9a36244f0de51fa`. Input 0.000450500467045840 ETH; signed gas price 3.205000088 gwei. Confirmed success; actual gas 21,000, gas cost 0.000067305001848000 ETH. Monad output: 1.201237 USDC. Monad receipt transaction: `0x38a2b495369784e90c3cdd985755b6da54f06ecf87b19e84fd37a67db27dcaf2`. Both destination USDC Transfer events were independently verified against the exact token, recipient and output amount.

The new test configuration uses the same destination addresses on Ethereum and Robinhood, 10/90 confidential payout weights, and one saved 70/30 source-budget snapshot. Both recoveries settled successfully, totaling **2.928620 USDC**. Final Ethereum liquid balances are **0 ETH / 0 USDC**, with the old shares unchanged. Total Ethereum gas spent was **0.000257311431155248 ETH**. The saved Monad source balance is **10.932509 USDC** at block 109102614. `.local/test-budget.json` reserves **7.652756 USDC for Ethereum** and **3.279753 USDC for Robinhood**, including source gas. No new earn test was funded. The Ethereum test still rejects the old nonzero vault position before funding; the recovery does not bypass that check.
