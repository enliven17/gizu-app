# Native signer verification

Historical evidence consolidated on 2026-10-08; no checks were rerun for this edit.
Counts describe the recorded revisions, not current suite totals. Replacement and
retired signer results are separated because they prove different boundaries.
Current architecture: [signer overview](NATIVE_SIGNER.md). Setup:
[local development](../app-guide/MOBILE_LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md).

The iOS tests covered assertion rejection, corrupt storage/missing key, shared
backup/derivation fixtures, expiry/cancellation, restart, stale revision and
identical-byte recovery. Android and iOS shared backup fixtures, but this did not
establish cross-platform provider recovery compatibility.

Historical tool failures included Expo 57.0.24 versus expected 57.0.25 and an unused
`colors` import in `WaveBackdrop.tsx`; these are dated observations, not current
bugs. Local CI configuration/builds did not establish a remote CI run.

## Superseded release configuration

September 28 used a testnet-only Release flag and recorded pending signing,
association and distribution setup. September 30 replaced that flag with
`GizuWalletEnabled`, shared production/TestFlight identity and `gizu.io`.
Do not apply the older release instructions or treat their pending deployment
statements as current. Current identities and signing procedure live in
[passkey configuration](../app-guide/PASSKEY_CONFIGURATION.md).

Synthetic checks use reference inputs only, never real passkey secrets in JS.
The transfer vector example and `scripts/verify-transfer.mjs` independently decode
and recover native outputs. CI native generation/build configuration exists;
local results do not establish hosted CI/Linux success. CI's ephemeral Android
signing key must not be published in domain associations.

Previously recorded failure: Expo Doctor 20/21, installed Expo 57.0.24 versus
expected 57.0.25. This is historical until rerun, not a newly observed result.

## Retired signer physical Android evidence

N1 user reported success on A142 / Android 16. Provider identity, exact revision,
prompt count and boundary instrumentation were not fully recorded.

N2 user completed a 0.001 MON transfer after funding Account 0. Historical read-only
RPC checks confirmed successful receipt, chain 10143, 21,000 gas and a block below
the finalized head:

- Sender: `0x90ad2f19302ED5439B69659Bbc5D6d8c5b7dDf95`
- Recipient: `0x0e4e77B43a94A704E2a7a005238038F3EF00f407`
- Hash: `0xb3b9b115ec88086227c30cb712ba832b3604b2baaae771d9b70bf1b4ddbe9cb6`

User reported one unlock and one native approval for two further 0.001 MON transfers.
Historical RPC checks confirmed the same sender/recipient and consecutive nonces 1, 2:

- `0x6f67dafae7bb847dae6e6a1c6ebda51947fc98eccfc46e0c83028962252eee97`
- `0x1bd53bddc7b452dac29f69ce1de2ab5e9ad357275d11dd84bf942ed090602bdb`

User reported three finalized records after reopening and still three after
cancelling before approval. This supports completed-record persistence and one
cancellation case, not process-death safety during uncertain submission.
N3 screenshots showed a different zero-balance account and recovery of the funded
Account 0 with 19.990574 testnet MON: Android access/balance evidence only.

Earlier 2026-09-23 JavaScript-probe success proved derivation/recovery/test signing
on one provider; it does not prove the replacement native secret boundary.

## Retired signer main-app evidence

At that revision, Home, Account, Deposit/Withdraw and Activity used native adapters. Functional
coverage mocks those boundaries and exercises validation, duplicate prevention,
status display, missing legacy details, refresh failure, leaving a page during an
operation, disconnect and stale results. Native-only signing policy is unchanged.
Main-app physical acceptance remains outstanding; debug-harness evidence does not
complete it. Installation/build success is not an accepted live journey.

## Historical acceptance gaps

These were open in the original records. They are not a current release-blocker
list; later acceptance must be established from dated evidence, not inferred.

- Physical iOS PRF create/open/recovery, review, cancellation and provider behavior.
- Android provider/device/revision/prompt record and native synthetic-secret
  instrumentation across returns, events, errors, logs and generated bindings.
- Hostile JS: removed bridge/secret exports inaccessible; no approve bypass, altered
  chain/recipient/value/fees/index, extra steps, replay, expiry or concurrent escalation.
- Review accessibility, overlay/touch protections, provider pauses versus background,
  teardown and late callbacks on both platforms.
- 13-transfer one-unlock batch: not run. Synthetic 16-signature proof is different.
- Partial-batch cancellation and uncertain-submission restart: not run. Preserve
  already-broadcast hashes, stop remaining authority, reconcile without resending.
- Insufficient funds on an unfunded account: explicit device acceptance still open.
- Independent FFI/memory/dependency/license/update-trust review and security audit.
- Signed production builds, recovery/domain loss/account discovery, web isolation
  and privacy decisions before real-funds release.

Record future results with revision, device/OS/provider, build type, prompts and
public hashes/statuses. Never capture real credential secrets or heap dumps.
