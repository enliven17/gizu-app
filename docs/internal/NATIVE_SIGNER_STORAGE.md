# Native storage, authorization and wallet recovery

**Complexity: 2 — Technical.** [Signer overview](NATIVE_SIGNER.md).

Extracted from the signer reference on 2026-10-08. This split preserves the
recorded implementation details; it is not a new device, provider or security
verification. See [dated verification evidence](NATIVE_SIGNER_VERIFICATION.md).

**Version note:** the sections below describe the original version-1 backup.
The current [TypeScript contract](../../mobile/src/domain/wallet/storedSigner.ts)
declares backup version 2. Consult current native codecs before making format or
compatibility assumptions; the historical details below are not a v2 specification.

## iOS storage and authorization

The replacement includes a Swift Expo module backed by the stored-wallet Rust core.
Local AES-GCM records and the operation journal live in completely protected,
backup-excluded Application Support files. A non-synchronizing Keychain key uses
`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly`; missing keys require recovery,
not automatic wallet replacement. This protects storage at rest, not hardware-enforced
transaction authorization. Native code owns verification, approval and secret use.

AuthenticationServices registration/assertions are checked for the expected credential,
challenge, RP, `https://gizu.io` origin, presence, verification and P-256 signature.
Creation proves PRF availability before generating entropy. iOS uses the same backup
format v1 and derivation, but a platform-local wallet record and journal format.
Document selection, save/reopen verification and restore remain native. Restore asks
for address confirmation without retaining entropy/PRF across that confirmation;
fresh PRF authorization commits the recovery. Initial acceptance is iPhone-to-iPhone;
Android/iOS recovery-provider interoperability is not yet accepted.

Native full-screen review uses the existing visual language and keeps Cancel available
through preparation. Exact-transfer limits, encrypted signed-before-broadcast journaling,
read-only reconciliation and explicitly authorized identical-byte retries match Android.
Capability adapters query native capabilities before entering each operation; module
presence alone is insufficient. Release availability requires the signed
`GizuWalletEnabled` build flag. Simulator checks
are separate from pending physical-device/provider and independent security acceptance.

## Verified backup and recovery

Native `BackupActivity` owns Android document selection, credential prompts and file IO.
It is not exported. A process-local operation token and the module mutex bind it to
one pending native request; recreation/process death requires restarting the ceremony.
An encrypted file is saved with `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`, reopened with
`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`, then decrypted using a fresh verified passkey PRF result.
Native comparison checks wallet identity, credential, entropy and all 16 derived
addresses before atomically persisting `ready`. Cancellation/failure preserves the
same wallet in `backupRequired`; repeating backup on a ready wallet preserves readiness.

Backup version 1 encrypts 32-byte entropy using AES-256-GCM and the 32-byte recovery
PRF result as key. AAD binds format/version, RP, derivation version, wallet UUID and
credential ID/P-256 public key. Files are limited to 64 KiB. Backup plaintext and
PRF never cross Expo; owned buffers are cleared before document selection. Provider
and managed-runtime copies cannot be guaranteed to be erased. Two fresh passkey
checks are expected for save and reopen verification.

Android local binary storage version 4 retains the version-3 journal-generation UUID
and adds the selected Earn chain and a restore reconciliation gate. Version-2 records
retain readiness and use their wallet UUID as journal generation; version-1 records
load as backup-required without changing entropy. Restore requires the encrypted
file and its original passkey, validates authenticated metadata and derivation,
and re-encrypts under a local Keystore key. Only absent/unreadable storage can be
restored; readable wallets cannot be overwritten. Restore does not recover local
transaction history. Lost-passkey recovery and web sharing remain deferred.

The two-minute ceremony deadline includes document selection. Backgrounding outside
native credential/document UI cancels; foreground/unlocked checks apply on return.
Automated tests cover codec/storage and mocked app flows, not device/provider/file
picker acceptance or independent security review.
