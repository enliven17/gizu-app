# Native signer overview

**Complexity: 2 — Technical.** Start here to find the contract for a wallet task.

## Active implementation

`GizuStoredSigner` is the active native wallet module. Swift and Kotlin own platform
integration; the shared Rust core owns wallet and operation policies. JavaScript
requests operations and receives public results. Native code owns secret material,
passkey authorization and transaction approval.

- [Public TypeScript contract](../../mobile/src/domain/wallet/storedSigner.ts)
- [Native module and build instructions](../../mobile/modules/gizu-stored-signer/README.md)
- [Passkey setup](../app-guide/PASSKEY_CONFIGURATION.md) and
  [troubleshooting](PASSKEY_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

Earn's feature behavior and rollout remain in [Confidential Earn](CONFIDENTIAL_EARN.md).
Detailed platform behavior stays with its owning topic; platform differences must
not be read as a claim of full parity.

## Status and evidence

The old `gizu-signer` module is disconnected; its reference is historical and must
not be used as the active API or as a fallback. The [migration record](SIGNER_MIGRATION.md)
preserves the transition decisions.

This index was split on 2026-10-08. Extracted sections preserve dated implementation
claims and acceptance limits; they are not newly verified deployment or device results.
The TypeScript contract currently declares backup version 2, while historical backup
sections describe version 1. Use current codecs when working on backup compatibility.
See [verification evidence](NATIVE_SIGNER_VERIFICATION.md) for recorded checks and gaps.
