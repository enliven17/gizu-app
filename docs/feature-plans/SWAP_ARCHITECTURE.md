# Swap architecture

**Complexity:** 3 — Detailed. **Status:** implemented architecture reference, not a new proposal.
**Reviewed:** 2026-10-08 against local source; no live provider or funded-device verification.
**Ownership:** component responsibilities below; individual maintainer assignment is not recorded.

## Purpose and scope

Explain who can propose, approve, sign, submit, persist and recover a Gizu swap.
This is the starting point for technical changes to the existing confidential swap.

Read alongside:

- [Contracts and provider boundaries](SWAP_CONTRACTS.md): bridge, core and gateway interfaces.
- [Persistence and recovery](SWAP_PERSISTENCE.md): durable state, crash boundaries and platform differences.
- [Aurora flow](AURORA_SWAP_FLOW.md): buy/sell illustrations and privacy explanation.
- [Failure guide](../internal/SWAP_FAILURES.md): phases, pause codes and investigation actions.

This describes the stored-wallet swap implementation, not Earn's independent
execution pipeline or the retired signer. Catalog browsing across multiple networks
does not expand executable swap support: the inspected UI gates selections to
chain 4663 and `swapListed`, and native/provider policy is separately enforced.
The current execution path uses Monad USDC, confidential credit and Robinhood USDG
as the intermediate asset for a Fusion token trade.

## Ownership and authority

| Layer                         | Owns                                                                                                                             | Does not own                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| React Native                  | Token selection, amount input, public status, navigation, user intent and bridge invocation                                      | Keys, signature bytes, native approval or authoritative settlement                |
| Swift / Kotlin                | Wallet access, native review/passkey flow, platform lifecycle, transport, durable storage and driving core requests              | Permission to substitute an unchecked transaction for the reviewed core operation |
| Shared Rust core              | Plan validation, derivation, request sequence, quote/order constraints, signatures, state transitions and public status          | HTTP execution, platform file I/O, passkey UI or independently verified consensus |
| Gizu backend                  | Validate gateway request shape, hold provider API keys, prepare unsigned funding/orders, relay signed requests and expose status | Wallet private keys or authority to approve a swap                                |
| Aurora / confidential Intents | Asset registry, route quotes, deposit/payout processing, private-balance authentication and route status                         | Native user approval or proof that a subsequent Fusion trade completed            |
| Pimlico                       | Funding preparation, ERC-20 paymaster/bundler services and UserOperation submission/receipt                                      | App wallet signing; gas sponsorship is not a free-funds guarantee                 |
| 1inch Fusion                  | Executable previews, permit context, order construction, relayer status and resolver execution                                   | The app's local minimum-output, receiver and order-binding approval policy        |
| Chain RPC                     | Chain identity, balances, nonces, receipts and transfer logs used in checks                                                      | Native authorization; RPC responses are observations, not light-client proofs     |

The backend's funding owner is explicitly watch-only: signing methods throw.
A malicious or malformed service response must still pass native validation.
Native code remains inside the signed-app trust boundary; this is not protection
against a malicious native update, compromised device or all provider collusion.

## Control flow

1. React Native validates an entered amount for representation and sends user intent
   through the capability-checked bridge. UI validation is not spending authority.
2. Native code opens the wallet, selects/reserves eligible accounts and persists
   recipient allocation before creating the core operation.
3. Rust produces one next action: request, wait, review, unlock, pause or finish.
4. Native code persists state before issuing a request. It supplies the response
   with its request ID; Rust validates it and chooses the next transition.
5. At review/unlock boundaries the native screen obtains the required passkey
   authorization. A JavaScript callback cannot approve a core operation.
6. Signed payloads remain native and travel through the backend to providers.
   Receipts, route credit, fills and balances drive subsequent checks.
7. React Native receives a public view. A returned native call can mean paused or
   awaiting action; it does not necessarily mean the swap completed.

This is a persisted state machine, not one atomic cross-chain transaction. Funding,
payouts and token trades can complete independently and leave recoverable residuals.

## Operation variants

| Variant                | Starting funds                              | Main path                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `confidentialSwap`     | Selected public Monad USDC source           | Sponsored funding → confidential credit → recipient payouts → Fusion buys      |
| `confidentialPayout`   | Existing authenticated confidential balance | Read available private balance → payouts → Fusion buys; no new Monad deposit   |
| `confidentialSell`     | Selected allocated token-holder batch       | Fusion sale into Aurora deposit → confidential credit → fresh Monad recipients |
| `confidentialRecovery` | USDG left in allocated recipient accounts   | Bounded recipient scan → finish token purchases using those balances           |

The recovery variant is not generic cross-chain asset recovery. Sell holder and
return-recipient indices are distinct, validated sets. An available token in the
catalog is neither a route quote nor proof of Fusion liquidity.

## Shared engine versus platform orchestration

Both platforms consume the same `SwapOperation` through generated UniFFI bindings.
Those bindings are private native plumbing, not a JavaScript signing API.

Android additionally uses `NativeFundingPlanner`, `FundingReservations`,
`SwapFundingBatch` and an in-memory `SwapBatchApproval`. A user budget may span
multiple source accounts, with child core operations and a combined review.
The batch can contain completed sources while another child remains unfinished.

The inspected iOS `StoredSwapEngine` drives a single core operation and a smaller
active-state envelope. Do not infer Android batch persistence, funding selection
or combined-approval parity merely because the Rust engine is shared.

Read queues in the JavaScript bridge reduce overlapping native reads. They are not
a financial transaction lock or a replacement for native reservations, lifecycle
checks and operation ownership. See [persistence](SWAP_PERSISTENCE.md).

## Privacy and observability boundaries

Public-chain funding and destination transfers remain visible. Confidential credit
is the private middle segment; providers and the gateway can still observe parts
of the route and correlate timing or amounts. This architecture does not guarantee
unlinkability.

Backend routes use POST bodies for address-bearing status requests to avoid wallet
links in ordinary URL logs. That does not hide the request from the gateway/provider.
Diagnostics should contain route, stage, classified status and timing—not bodies,
provider keys, access tokens or exported state. See [failure diagnostics](../internal/SWAP_FAILURES.md).

## Change and acceptance requirements

Changes to routes or assets must update native pins/validation, gateway adapters,
UI eligibility and recovery together. Enabling a catalog option alone is insufficient.
Changes to persisted state need versioning and migration/restore tests; changes to
approval must preserve exact plan/amount/receiver binding and expiry behavior.

Before claiming a change works, distinguish:

- Rust/state-machine and provider-response fixture tests.
- Swift/Kotlin storage, lifecycle and transport tests.
- React Native public-contract and interaction tests.
- Real device passkey/foreground/cancellation checks.
- Quote-only provider probes versus funded settlement and residual recovery.

No architecture document or mocked test establishes present provider availability.
